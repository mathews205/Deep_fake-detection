Deepfake Detection Project
This project develops a deepfake detection model using XceptionNet, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network. The workflow includes dataset preparation, frame extraction, data splitting, model training, and evaluation.


Project Workflow
Dataset Preparation:
Videos are categorized into real and fake folders.
Frames are extracted and split into training, validation, and testing sets.
Model Fine-Tuning:
The pre-trained XceptionNet model (ImageNet weights) is fine-tuned for binary classification (real vs. fake).
Model Evaluation:
Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC are used to assess performance.
Results Visualization:
Confusion matrix and ROC curve are generated for evaluation.

etup Instructions
1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.12.6 installed.
2. Environment Setup
Create a virtual environment:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:
Linux/Mac: source venv/bin/activate
Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Dataset Preparation
Place videos in:
dataset/real/: Real videos.
dataset/fake/: Fake videos.
Run the frame extraction script:
bash
Copy code
python scripts/extract_frames.py
Split the frames into train, validation, and test sets:
bash
Copy code

How to Train and Evaluate the Model
Train the Model: Use the model_training.ipynb notebook to fine-tune the model. This includes:

Loading the pre-trained XceptionNet model.
Fine-tuning the last few layers.
Training with the prepared dataset.
Evaluate the Model:

Metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC are calculated in the notebook.
Visualizations (confusion matrix and ROC curve) are saved in the evaluation/ folder.
Dependencies
